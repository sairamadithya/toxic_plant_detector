# toxic_plant_detector
this project is all about the pretrained CNN(mobilenetv2) which is capable of differentiating toxic plants from the safe plants using transfer learning.
the dataset consists of approximately 1200 training samples and 100 testing samples.
the dataset contains set of toxic and safe images of several plants.
the model is trained for this data and can be tested using distinct testing images given in the repository
however this is not an efficient method since the visuals are not enough to categorise the plants. chemical analysis which indicate the presence of certain poisonous chemicals can indicate the toxicity.
also the plant can be toxic based on the concentration taken and the body type. these factors cant be determined by the model.
